# Public HTTPS FLAC: intermittent output failure

## Quiet candidate evidence

The fresh public-file campaign on `idf61-tailq-20261015` reports **15/16**.
Automatic FLAC, both Opus cases and both Vorbis cases pass. Explicit FLAC
records **three new DMA completion-queue drops** and zero write errors in
the fixed 56.148-second steady observation. Its first decoded format is at
5.571 seconds; the increments occur between observations at 8.820 and 9.372
seconds, after the existing three-second decoded-playback warmup.

This is a real output-counter failure, distinct from the earlier FLAC
three-sample memory comparison. The unchanged memory, format, natural EOF,
decoder and settled-recovery checks now pass. Expected duration is 60.480 s;
observed decoded playback is 60.568 s. The same image's immediately preceding
automatic FLAC case has zero new drops over 56.049 s. Neither pass erases the
failed explicit case.

Around the event, the board reports FLAC 44.1-kHz stereo, RSSI about -59 dBm,
60–71 KB free heap and largest blocks of at least 43,008 B during the case.
Maximum paired WebUI response is 542.695 ms. Across all 863 campaign health
samples there are zero allocation, decoder and watchdog faults, one boot and
no failed traced HTTP request. These measurements do not identify whether
incoming data, decoding or scheduling caused the lost completions.

[Original reports, independent replay and event neighborhood](../tests/results/esp32c3-input-tail-quiet-20261015/final/)
retain the failed gate, exact boundaries and source hashes. Original firmware
and settings were restored, with playback stopped. The controller did **not**
run OTA after the failing file suite. The candidate remains unqualified.

## Diagnostic image

The diagnostic build starts from the exact quiet candidate configuration and
changes only `CONFIG_YORADIO_PIPELINE_HEALTH_DIAGNOSTIC=n→y`. Codec/DSP, TLS,
input capacity, output priority, QIO and clock settings remain the same.

The existing recorder exposes phase counts, the last 16 DMA-overrun events,
ages of output/PCM/input/network checkpoints and numeric queue occupancy.
There is no console output, sampler task or audio-data logging. It changes ISR
work and layout: success on this image cannot qualify the quiet image.
Build/link audits and the one-option configuration comparison pass.

[Saved diagnostic artifact](../firmware/development/esp32c3-idf61-flac-output-diagnostic/)
and [build evidence](../tests/results/esp32c3-flac-output-diagnostic-20261015/build/)
are retained. The physical controller runs up to three pairs of AUTO/explicit
FLAC observations on the same boot, stopping the campaign after the first
failed pair. Each pair completes its observations and recovery checks before
restoration. Preserve every failure and report overwritten events explicitly.
Use the ISR evidence to choose a targeted fix; do not increase input capacity
or change task priority without evidence of the bottleneck.
