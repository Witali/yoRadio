## Changes

- Added an RFC 9112-compatible low-memory HTTP stream parser: correct authority/port
  handling, relative redirects, chunked transfer decoding and bounded socket I/O.
- Made HTTP Server sends nonblocking and deadline-bounded, with correct transient
  errno handling matching the Espressif transport conventions.
- Closed short static/API sessions explicitly, limited the accept backlog and
  bounded active TCP PCBs so connection bursts cannot exhaust the ESP8266 heap.
- Reduced TCP MSS/window memory while preserving enough throughput for radio.
- Fixed Next/Previous so the search starts after, rather than at, the current
  HTTP station.

## Validation

- All 239 repository regression tests passed, including native C tests for URL,
  redirect, header-token and fragmented chunked-body handling.
- The physical Wemos D1 mini joined Wi-Fi at `192.168.100.6`. Root HTML, gzip
  JavaScript, the 53,808-byte playlist and native status all returned HTTP 200.
- Twelve concurrent HTTP requests completed successfully; afterwards ping was
  3/3 with 0% loss and the full playlist was served again.
- A real non-default-port HTTP stream with a query played as AAC at 61 kbit/s.
- WebSocket Play, Pause, Next, Previous and Stop status scenarios all passed.
